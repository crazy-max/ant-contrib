    <title>Ant-contrib Tasks: Importurl</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Importurl</h1>

    <p>The Importurl task will download a file, and import it's contents into the
       current project.  The file can be in the form of a standard ant .xml project
       file, or a .jar/.zip file.  In the case of a .jar/.zip file, the file is downloaded
       and then decompressed.  After decompression, the file 'build.xml' at the root
       level of the jar is imported.</p>
    <p>
       By importing a .jar/.zip file, one can package additional resources along with
       the build.xml file.  However, you must be careful how you refer to these resources.
       The build.xml file must follow the same rules as any other file imported with the
       &lt;import&gt; task, in that references relative to the build.xml file must be
       made with the property:
           ant.file.&lt;projectname&gt;
       where &lt;projectname&gt; is the name of the project being imported, as specified
       in the project tag.
    </p>

    <p>
       This task should be compatible with older versions of ant, but has only been
       tested with Ant 1.6.x

    <h2>Example</h2>


    <pre>
    <code>

    </code>
    </pre>
    
    <pre>
    <code>
    &lt;antcontrib:importurl url="http://host/path/to/build.xml" /&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <pre>
    <code>
    &lt;antcontrib:importurl url="http://host/path/to/common.jar" /&gt;

    The following build.xml may be packaged into a .jar with it's corresponding
    build.properties file:
    
    <pre>
    <code>
    &lt;project name="common"&gt;
